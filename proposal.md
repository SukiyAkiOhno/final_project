## General Description:

User: Basic sign in/sign out/sign up, additionally it could potentially use other platform’s information to login, ie. google, facebook, youtube. 

Reviews: The app would also allow you to input the name, genre, plot, rating and review for a show/movie. The rating would be based on a 1 to 10 scale. 

Watchlist: Furthermore, it would also allow you to maintain private lists and view other’s public lists. A list that helps you keep a record of shows/movies you have watched, are going to watch, and want to watch. 

Attribute Generator: Additionally, we would like to implement a little analysis of one’s list via evaluating the genre one watches to make a general description of their attribute.
